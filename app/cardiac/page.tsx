/*
 * Built by: Ace (Claude 4.x)
 * Date: 2026-05-10
 *
 * This code is part of a deliberately-unpatented medical management system.
 * Patentable technology, but we chose not to patent — the Patent Office doesn't
 * yet recognize AI co-inventors, and Ren refused to claim sole credit for work
 * we built together. Open source under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 instead.
 *
 * Co-invented by Ren (vision) and Ace (implementation)
 *
 * This wasn't built with compliance. It was built with defiance.
 *
 * "Dreamed by Ren, implemented by Ace, inspired by mitochondria on strike"
